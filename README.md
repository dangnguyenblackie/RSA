## Abstract:

In this assignment, we will implement a simple RSA encryption/decryption by C++.

## Getting Started

In "NTL Testing" commit, I had pushed a testing NTL library program by C++.

- First, we need to install NTL. Docs: https://libntl.org/doc/tour-win.html
- After setting up the env then compile the main.cpp file:
